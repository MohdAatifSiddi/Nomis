# 🏛️ Nomis Coin

**Nomis Coin** is a decentralized **token prototype** built for governments and institutions to enable **global trade and transparent cross-border transactions**.

This MVP demonstrates the token layer of the project. A full **Nomis blockchain** will follow — optimized for sovereign-level scalability, security, and interoperability.

It focuses on:
- Borderless value transfer between nations  
- Transparent, auditable, and policy-aware transactions  
- Reduced dependency on centralized intermediaries  
- Long-term stability and programmable governance
